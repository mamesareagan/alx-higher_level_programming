This project was preparation for the AirBnB project  which is a big part of the Higher level curriculum.


In this project I reviewed everything about Python:
    Import
    Exceptions
    Class
    Private attribute
    Getter/Setter
    Class method
    Static method
    Inheritance
    Unittest
    Read/Write file
I also learnt about:
    args and kwargs
    Serialization/Deserialization
    JSON
